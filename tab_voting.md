Josh Sokol motions, Matt Konda secondsModification: The original proposal removed the board approval from specific types of reimbursements and payables.

The proposed modification would allow for the release of funds from the US bank for any of the specific reimbursement categories below. As we are currently doing, the details of all payables will be sent to the board during the bi-monthly payment batches so the board is apprised of all payables regardless of the categories below. |

"| 2017-05-16  | Passes: 6-0            |  Motion1. Allow the organisers of the Summit to spend up to $50k USD using funds allocated from the original $150k seed allocation to fund OWASP staff attendance and other activities as set set out in emails to the Board and in the Summit Budget
2. Cost to OWASP - up to $50k USD. Organisers will continue to work with OWASP staff to ensure that sponsorships and income is booked through the Foundation, as the event will likely make a loss. The Board requests the Summit organizers to minimise spending on necessary items and aim for break even, to ensure as minimal a loss as possible. However, the Board should be under no illusions that the event will break even, and will likely make a loss of up to $50k.
3. Debrief. Once all bills are paid and certainly before AppSec USA, the Board must have a one hour debrief with OWASP's Event Manager and the Summit organisers to determine if OWASP will ever do such an event again, what changes need to be made (regional / global, location, timing, funding, marketing, media, etc), objectives hit, and lessons learned.
